## Student Roster

#### July 27th, 2017 by Erica Cha

#### Description
-  Build a simple app to manage all the students in a class. With Angular, we can add, edit and delete students as well as filter them on a single page, with relatively little work.
(Build complex user interface with a new set of tools called client-side MVCs. MVC stands for model-view-controller, which is a way of setting up user interfaces that separates out the code into three interconnected parts: model, view, controller. A client-side MVC provides structure for your JavaScript code and automates common tasks.)
